This project leverages AI agents (using LangChain and potentially other tools) to automate the collection and analysis of restaurant reviews from various websites.  It distills these reviews into concise summaries and extracts key positive and negative points.

## Key Features

* **Automated Scraping:** Efficiently gathers restaurant reviews from multiple sources (e.g., Google Reviews, Yelp, TripAdvisor, etc.).
* **AI-Powered Summary Generation:** Employs advanced natural language processing (NLP) models to generate clear and informative summaries of each review.
* **Sentiment Analysis:**  Identifies and classifies the overall sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of reviews and individual points.
* **Pain Point/Good Point Extraction:**  Automatically extracts specific positive aspects (e.g., "great service," "delicious food") and negative aspects (e.g., "slow service," "overpriced").
* **Visualization (Optional):** Provides options to visualize sentiment trends, common pain points, and comparisons across restaurants.

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Uses web scraping techniques (e.g., BeautifulSoup, Scrapy) or APIs to collect reviews from target websites.
   - Stores raw review data in a structured format.

2. **Preprocessing:**
   - Cleans the data (e.g., removes irrelevant text, handles typos).
   - Tokenizes and standardizes text for better NLP processing.

3. **AI Analysis:**
   - Applies LangChain agents to:
      - Summarize reviews concisely.
      - Perform sentiment analysis to classify overall tone.
      - Identify and extract specific pain points and good points.

4. **Output & Visualization:**
   - Generates a summary report for each restaurant, listing pain points, good points, and the overall sentiment.
   - Optionally provides visualizations (graphs, charts) to reveal insights.

## Installation
